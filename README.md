# Assessment-4---InterfaceAndVirtualMethods

            //S - Our Square class is only responsible for properties and methods related directly to it
            //O - We extend the Shape class into the Square class instead of just modfying Shape
            //L - We override the parent method in Draw() for the same functionality buy polymorphed for Square
            //I - Our Square is not given anything it does not need via inheritence (or interfaces if we used that)
            //D - We use abstraction to inherit to our Square class and only depend on the parent class
